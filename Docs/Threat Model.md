# Threat Model:

## Introduction:
This Threat Model documents the potential security concerns behind my automated curtain IoT project.

### About the System:
The system uses a Raspberry-Pi connected to a remote device which acts as the controller over a local WiFi network. The remote device sends commands to the Raspberry-Pi either through manual intervention or the Raspberry-Pi will retrieve data about the local area's time of sunrise and sunset via an external API and operate the curtains accordingly. The use of a remote connection and the retrieval of data from a third party raises some security concerns which need to be evaluated through a security analysis.

### Approach:
We will be using the OWASP Threat Modelling approach, this will allow us to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with this system. Within this approach we will be using the STRIDE methodology, it was made by Microsoft and it divides threats into 6 categories:
- Spoofing -> related to Authentication.
- Tampering -> related to Integrity.
- Repudiation -> related to Non-Repudiation.
- Information Disclosure -> related to Confidentiality.
- Denial of Service -> related to Availability.
- Elevation of Privilege -> related to Authorisation.

## Scope and Objectives:

### Objectives:
- Identify potential security issues with the system.
- Assess the risks of each identified threat.
- Provide mitigations to these threats.
- Define security goals to facilitate gap analysis and evaluation of the finished implementation once the project is complete.

### In the Scope (what this threat model covers):
- The remote connection between the controller and the Raspberry-Pi over the local WiFi network.
- The connection between the Raspberry-Pi and the external API over the internet.
- The Raspberry-Pi itself.

### Out of Scope (what this threat model omits):
- Physical attacks directly on the hardware of the system.
- Integrations with smart-home platforms such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
- Attacks directed towards the client's device or the local WiFi network.

## System Decomposition:
Below is a DFD diagram which breaks down the system into its components, the flow of data and the trust boundaries. This allows us to analyse each element of the diagram using STRIDE.

### Figure 1: Data Flow Diagram

### Components:
- Client's device (controller) -> This will be the client's device on which they can send commands to the Raspberry-Pi over the local network.
- Sunrise/Sunset API -> This is a third party service which will give data about the time of sunrise/sunset in the client's local area.
- Configuration Store -> This store is within the Raspberry-Pi and will store config details such as setting and credentials. The curtain control application will be able to read/write to it.

### Processes:
- Application for curtain control -> This software is on the Raspberry-Pi and it receives commands from the client's device and receives sunrise/sunset data from the external API. This will cause electrical signals to be sent to the motor which operates the opening/closing of the curtains.

### Data Flows:
- The client's device sends commands (such as open, close or stop the curtain) to the Raspberry-Pi's curtain control application remotely over the local network.
- The Raspberry-Pi's curtain control application returns status information to the client's device remotely over the local network.
- The Raspberry-Pi's curtain control application requests and receives data about the sunrise/sunset in the client's local area from an external API over the internet.
- The Raspberry-Pi's curtain control application reads from and writes to the configuration store.
- The Raspberry-Pi's curtain control application sends electrical signals to the motor to control it.

### Trust Boundaries:
- Boundary 1 -> This boundary encapsulates the local WiFi network where commands are sent between the client's device and Raspberry-Pi over it. Over the WiFi network any device can be a potential threat, so this boundary can't be completely trusted.
- Boundary 2 -> This boundary encapsulates the internet where sunrise/sunset information and requests for it are being sent between the external API and the Raspberry-Pi. This data is outside our zone of control so has to be treated as untrusted. We must therefore implement data validation.

## Threat Identification (STRIDE):
### Figure 2: STRIDE Table

NOTE: After reviewing the STRIDE table above i've noticed the majority of security concerns arise from the same things, such as: no authentication, no/weak encrytion, the absence of logging, no input validation and no rate-limiting. Addressing these issues will mitigate the majority of threats towards this system.

## Risk Assessment:
Each risk is rated by the likelihood of it happening and the imact it would have if it did occur. These 2 are then combined using a risk matrix to provide an overall risk rating.

### Figure 3: Risk Matrix

### Figure 4: Risk Ratings

I've found the highest risks are: Spoofing and Information Disclosure at both the curtain control application and on the data flow between the application and the client's device. The majority of issues stem from: a lack in authentication and a lack in encryption of data in-transit. Therfore we must put more resources towards mitigating these issues.
